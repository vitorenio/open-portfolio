# open-portfolio
This project aims to provide a lightweight and simple platform to monitor your crypto-portfolio balance.

# Why did I created this?
I couldn`t find any simple portfolio where I could control all my shitcoins balances in a flexible way. I currently have dozens of altcoins in my bag and I can find 99% of its current market value at https://coinmarketcap.com/

So, this platform intends to provide a way to configure wich altcoins I have and list them accordingly to the prices provided by coinmarketcap's REST API.
